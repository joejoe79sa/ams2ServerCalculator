# ams2ServerCalculator

Quick basic ams2 page to decode current flag values or generate a new value for flags.

1. Make sure to have python and pip installed.
2. Run pip install flask
3. In the app directory, run the following command to start. 
	python app.py
4. Brows site in browser using http://127.0.0.1:5000


Added the flags to app.py from the api call /api/list/flags/session on my dedicated server. Can update if they change by editing app.py.
Planning to add fucntion to grab the values from API rather than hard coding but I just wanted to get something up to help for now
